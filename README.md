[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shityhiking/website-generator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shityhiking/website-generator)
  
  
Templating to simplify changes in [shityhiking.github.io](shityhiking.github.io)

### Inspiration
All the chnages should happen here making the [shityhiking.github.io](shityhiking.github.io) complety auto generated. 

#### CI/CD and Fail safe
Any chnage should trigger and hugo build and update [shityhiking.github.io](shityhiking.github.io) only when build and test succeeds
  
#### Make common changes easier
Changes that are common can be changed really fast
  
#### Seperate Dynamic / Static webfront
Only provide static content, everything dynamic happens elsewhere by API.
